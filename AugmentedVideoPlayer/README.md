Augmented Video Player
======================

This project is about using the Vuforia virtual button to control the 3D models and video-player which is present in our application. 

Things used:
* I've used Vuforia ARToolkit and integrated with Unity in order to create AR models in the real world.
* I've used two static videos in the application. We can even use video URLs instead of directly placing videos in the app so that we can save some memory.
* Vuforia virtual buttons which act like play and pause button.

How to use:
1) Initially, point the phone camera towards the image/vuforia plane. You will notice a video being played.
2) You can also see two options over the video player. One option is to pause the video which is currently being played and the other option is to play the next video.
3) Hover the hand on one of the options and you can see the video either being paused or a new video being played.

Extensions:
This project can further be extended to an app where the user can input an URL or file (audio/video) and will see the file playing with all the available options.
